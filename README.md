KokBot
======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kokarn/KokBot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kokarn/KokBot)

Just a basic node bot for our irc channel.

It sports a pretty decent plugin system with the following support:

* Notifications via [Telegram](https://telegram.org)
* Notifications via [Pushbullet](https://www.pushbullet.com)
* RSS Feed subscriptions and notifications
* Todays music mix
* Github activity monitoring and notification
* Url identification
* Http status codes as cats over Telgram

If you want to build your own plugin, look at the HttpCat plugin. That's the basics
